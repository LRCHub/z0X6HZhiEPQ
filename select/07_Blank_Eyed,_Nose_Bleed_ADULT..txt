I'm coming to get you.
I'm coming to find you.
Say hello to your new best friend.

Blank eyed, nose bleed

Wouldn't it be nice,
To go to a party,
And be the only one there.

Blank eyed, nose bleed

I've been working on,
Increasing my anxiety,
It's something I can do for free.

Blank eyed, nose bleed

Seconds moving forward.
Second moving backwards.
