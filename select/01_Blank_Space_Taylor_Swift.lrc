[00:05.58] Nice to meet you, where you been?
[00:08.14] I could show you incredible things
[00:10.69] Magic, madness, heaven, sin
[00:13.22] Saw you there and I thought
[00:15.14] "Oh, my God, look at that face
[00:17.68] You look like my next mistake
[00:20.06] Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
[00:35.06] 
[00:25.83] New money, suit and tie
[00:28.13] I can read you like a magazine
[00:31.08] Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
[00:33.25] And I know you heard about me
[00:35.46] So hey, let's be friends
[00:37.57] I'm dying to see how this one ends
[00:40.12] Grab your passport and my hand
[00:42.51] I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
[01:03.51] 
[00:45.31] So it's gonna be forever
[00:48.04] Or it's gonna go down in flames
[00:50.36] You can tell me when it's over, mm
[00:52.72] If the high was worth the pain
[00:55.32] Got a long list of ex-lovers
[00:57.73] They'll tell you I'm insane
[01:00.31] 'Cause you know I love the players
[01:02.87] And you love the game
[01:13.37] 
[01:05.52] 'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
[01:07.73] We'll take this way too far
[01:10.53] It'll leave you breathless, mm
[01:12.88] Or with a nasty scar
[01:15.35] Got a long list of ex-lovers
[01:17.90] They'll tell you I'm insane
[01:20.54] But I've got a blank space, baby
[01:23.99] And I'll write your name
[01:35.99] 
[01:30.77] Cherry lips, crystal skies
[01:33.18] I could show you incredible things
[01:35.58] Stolen kisses, pretty lies
[01:38.10] You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
[01:40.43] Find out what you want
[01:42.47] Be that girl for a month
[01:45.06] Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
[02:04.06] 
[01:50.46] Screaming, crying, perfect storms
[01:53.21] I can make all the tables turn
[01:55.64] Rose garden filled with thorns
[01:58.22] Keep you second guessing like
[02:00.07] "Oh, my God, who is she?"
[02:02.41] I get drunk on jealousy
[02:04.95] But you'll come back each time you leave
[02:07.58] 'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
[02:35.58] 
[02:10.33] So it's gonna be forever
[02:12.90] Or it's gonna go down in flames
[02:15.15] You can tell me when it's over, mm
[02:17.87] If the high was worth the pain
[02:20.31] Got a long list of ex-lovers

[02:45.43] But I've got a blank space, baby
[02:48.95] And I'll write your name
[03:00.95] 
[02:50.40] Boys only want love if it's torture
[02:55.21] Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
[03:00.14] Boys only want love if it's torture
[03:05.20] Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
