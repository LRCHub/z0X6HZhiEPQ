[00:00.30] Blank Frank is the messenger of your doom and your destruction
[00:08.72] Yes, he is the one who will set you up as nothing
[00:26.88] And he is one who will look at you sideways
[00:34.75] His particular skill is leaving bombs in people's driveways.
[01:04.75] 
[01:38.42] Blank Frank has a memory that's as cold as an iceberg
[01:47.31] The only time he speaks is in incomprehensible proverbs
[01:55.72] Blank Frank is the siren, he's the air-raid, he's the crater
[02:05.19] He's on the menu, on the table, he's the knife and he's the waiter
