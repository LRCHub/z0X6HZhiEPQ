```
Come in, come in,
I could seat you by the fire
Listen, listen,
there's something I must confide
I know I said that it'd be fine
I know I made it
look like it'd be alright
But I think I learned my lesson
And I'm not gonna
let you out of my sight
You can call me killer
'Cause I'll bring you
to the light
And it might taste bitter
When your wits are aimed to God
You can call me killer
As you look into my eyes
Nothing but a sinner
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't, won't
You won't get away
You won't get away this time
(You won't get away this time)
(You won't get away this time)
(You won't get away this time)
(You won't get away this time)
(You won't get away this time)
(You won't get away this time)
(You won't get away this time)
(You won't get away,
won't get away)
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
You won't, won't, won't
You won't get away this time
You can call me killer
'Cause I'll bring you
to the light
And it might taste bitter
When your wits are aimed to God
You can call me killer
As you look into my eyes
Nothing but a sinner
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
Won't, won't, won't, won't
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't get away
Won't, won't
You won't get away
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You won't get away this time
You can call me killer
'Cause I'll bring you
to the light
And it might taste bitter
When your wits are aimed to God
You can call me killer
As you look into my eyes
Nothing but a sinner
You won't get away this time
